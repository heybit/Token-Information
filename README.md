Since the beginning of human history trading has been a universal way of
exchanging goods and services. In many ways trading made us who we are
now - it’s an essential part of our lives.
Every day billions of transactions take place around the world - we buy
food, talk on the phone, get paid for our jobs. And yet at the same time
we invest. We pay for our kids’ schools, buy houses, all with the purpose
of investing in our future and the future of our families.
Even though you might not notice it in your daily routine, the fact is clear:
modern life is impossible without trading and investing.
Now the time has come to take trading to the next level. W ith Hey
